## Python Essentials Practice with NumPy and Exception Handling

This Jupyter Notebook equips you with fundamental Python skills, covering:

* **Exception Handling:** Learn to catch and manage errors gracefully using `try...except...finally` blocks.
* **NumPy Basics:** Explore NumPy arrays for efficient numerical computations.

We'll start with exception handling, providing clear explanations and interactive examples using dictionaries, user input, and lists. This will help you:

* Handle missing dictionary keys.
* Prevent index errors in lists.
* Write code that anticipates and responds to potential errors effectively.

Next, we'll delve into NumPy, a powerful library for working with numerical data. We'll cover:

* Creating and manipulating NumPy arrays.
* Understanding array properties like dimensions and data types.
* Accessing elements within arrays effectively.
* Reshaping arrays for different use cases.

This practice session provides a solid foundation for further exploration of Python for data analysis, scientific computing, and more.
