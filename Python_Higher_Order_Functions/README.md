## Python Higher Order Functions

This Jupyter Notebook delves into the exciting worlds of higher-order functions (HOFs) and decorators in Python. Get ready to explore:

* **Higher-Order Functions:** Functions that return other functions or work with functions as arguments.
* **Nested Functions:** Defining functions within other functions, creating encapsulated scopes.
* **Decorator Functionality:** Dynamically adding behavior to existing functions using decorators.
* **Polymorphism:** Overriding (same function name with different behaviors in subclasses) and overloading (multiple functions with the same name but different arguments) for flexible function implementation.
* **Encapsulation:** Controlling access to attributes and methods within a class with public, protected, and private access modifiers.

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Grasp the power and applications of HOFs for reusable and concise code.
* Utilize decorators to enhance code readability and add functionalities (e.g., performance measurement).
* Explore various forms of polymorphism to create adaptable functions.
* Implement encapsulation principles for secure and well-structured object-oriented programming in Python.
