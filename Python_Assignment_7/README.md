## Data Visualization with Matplotlib

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exploring data visualization techniques in Python using the Matplotlib library.

**Week 9 assignment.ipynb:**

* This notebook delves into creating various data visualizations with Matplotlib, including:
    * Line plots
    * Scatter plots
    * Histograms
    * Bar charts
    * Heatmaps
* It leverages the Iris dataset to demonstrate practical application of these techniques.
* The notebook provides clear explanations and step-by-step guidance, making it suitable for both beginners and those with some Python experience.

**Getting Started:**

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to explore the visualizations.

**Feel free to:**

* Modify the code to explore different data visualization options with Matplotlib.
* Apply the learned techniques to visualize your own datasets.
