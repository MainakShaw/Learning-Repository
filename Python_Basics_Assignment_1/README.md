# Python Assignment 1 - Basic Input/Output, Calculations, and String Manipulation

This Jupyter notebook explores various fundamental Python concepts through an assignment structure. It covers:

* User Input/Output: Prompting the user for input using `input()` and formatting output messages using string concatenation and separation characters.
* Arithmetic Operations: Performing calculations like addition and conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures.
* String Manipulation: Capitalizing words within a sentence and checking for palindromes (strings that read the same backward as forward).

**Instructions:**

1. Save this file as `.ipynb`.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially using Jupyter Notebook.
