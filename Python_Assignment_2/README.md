# Python Assignment 2 - Lists, Sets, Dictionaries, and Loops

This Jupyter notebook tackles various data structures (lists, sets, dictionaries) and control flow mechanisms (loops) in Python through an assignment structure. It covers:

* **List Manipulation:** Finding common elements, finding the longest string, and filtering based on length.
* **Set Operations:** Finding unique elements and filtering odd numbers.
* **Dictionary Operations:** Finding keys with highest values and filtering based on specific key-value pairs.
* **Looping Constructs:** Utilizing `for` loops for iterating, summation, and vowel counting.

**Instructions:**

1. Save this file as `.ipynb`.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially using Jupyter Notebook.
