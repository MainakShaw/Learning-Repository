## Text Representation with TF-IDF and Word2Vec

This Jupyter Notebook explores techniques for representing text data in a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

**The notebook covers two key methods:**

* **TF-IDF Vectorizer:** Learn how to use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to represent documents as numerical vectors, capturing the importance of words within a document and across a corpus.
* **Word2Vec:** Discover Word2Vec, a word embedding technique that represents words as vectors in a high-dimensional space, capturing semantic relationships between words.

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Gain a solid understanding of TF-IDF and its role in document representation.
* Understand the concept of word embeddings and apply Word2Vec for word similarity tasks.
* Utilize these techniques to prepare text data for various NLP applications.

**Getting Started:**

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to explore the functionalities and experiment with different text examples.

**Feel free to:**

* Modify the example text data and explore different TF-IDF parameters.
* Train Word2Vec models on larger datasets and experiment with different hyperparameters.
* Apply these techniques to represent and analyze your own text data for machine learning tasks.
