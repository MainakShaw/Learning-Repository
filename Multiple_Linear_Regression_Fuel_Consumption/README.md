## Multiple Linear Regression for Fuel Consumption Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook delves into multiple linear regression, a powerful technique for modeling relationships between a dependent variable (CO2 emissions) and multiple independent variables (engine size, fuel consumption, cylinders). It explores the Fuel Consumption dataset.

**The notebook covers:**

* **Multiple Linear Regression Overview:** Understand the extension of simple linear regression to model a dependent variable with the influence of several independent variables.
* **Data Preparation:** Learn how to prepare the Fuel Consumption dataset, including selecting relevant features and splitting it into training and testing sets.
* **Model Building:** Discover how to build a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class.
* **Model Evaluation:** Explore techniques like R-squared score to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data (testing set).
* **Prediction:** Learn how to use the trained model to predict CO2 emissions for new data points with multiple features.

**Case Study: CO2 Emission Prediction**

The notebook applies multiple linear regression to predict CO2 emissions based on engine size, fuel consumption, and the number of cylinders. You'll learn to:

* Load and visualize the Fuel Consumption dataset.
* Select relevant features (engine size, fuel consumption, cylinders) as independent variables.
* Split the data into training and testing sets.
* Train a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn.
* Evaluate the model's performance using R-squared score.
* Predict CO2 emissions for new vehicles with specified engine size, fuel consumption, and number of cylinders.

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Gain a solid understanding of multiple linear regression concepts.
* Apply multiple linear regression for modeling relationships between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
* Evaluate and interpret the performance of a multiple linear regression model.
* Make predictions using a trained multiple linear regression model.

**Getting Started:**

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to explore multiple linear regression for fuel consumption prediction and visualize the results.

**Feel free to:**

* Use a different dataset with a continuous dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
* Explore more complex regression models (e.g., polynomial regression).
* Experiment with different feature selection techniques for multiple linear regression.
