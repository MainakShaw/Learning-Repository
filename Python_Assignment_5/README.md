## Weather-Air Pollution Analysis with Interactive Visualizations

This Jupyter Notebook explores the relationship between weather conditions and air pollution levels in a particular city over time.

**Key Functionalities:**

* **Data Exploration:** Analyzes a CSV dataset containing weather and air quality data.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Creates customizable line graphs, scatter plots, and a heat map using Matplotlib and IPywidgets.
* **User Interaction:** Enables users to select different variables for the x and y-axis in line graphs and scatter plots, as well as adjust line/dot colors.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Calculates and visualizes the correlation matrix between weather features using a heat map.

**Instructions:**

1. Download this Jupyter Notebook and the CSV data file (`Weather_Data.csv`) to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `ipywidgets`. You can use `pip install pandas matplotlib ipywidgets` in your terminal.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., JupyterLab) and run the cells.
4. Interact with the widgets to explore different visualizations and gain insights into the data.

**Expected Outcome:**

By manipulating the interactive elements, you can:

* Identify potential correlations between weather variables and air pollution levels.
* Gain a deeper understanding of how weather conditions might influence air quality.

**Additional Notes:**

* This project demonstrates the power of interactive data visualization for exploratory data analysis.
* Feel free to modify the code to explore different aspects of the data or customize the visualizations further.

**Libraries Used:**

* pandas
* matplotlib
* ipywidgets
