# Python Control Flow - Conditional Statements and Loops

This Jupyter notebook explores various control flow mechanisms in Python, including:

* **Conditional Statements:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions based on conditions.
* **Logical Operators:** Combining conditions with operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`.
* **Loops:** Utilizing `for` loops for repetitive tasks and iterating over lists.

**Instructions:**
