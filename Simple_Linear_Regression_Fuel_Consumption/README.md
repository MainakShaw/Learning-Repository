## Simple Linear Regression for Fuel Consumption Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a fundamental machine learning technique: simple linear regression. It explores the relationship between engine size and CO2 emissions in the Fuel Consumption dataset.

**The notebook covers:**

* **Simple Linear Regression Overview:** Understand the concept of simple linear regression, where a dependent variable (CO2 emissions) is modeled by a linear function of an independent variable (engine size).
* **Data Preparation:** Learn how to load, explore, and split the Fuel Consumption dataset into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
* **Model Building:** Discover how to build a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class.
* **Model Evaluation:** Explore techniques like R-squared score to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data (testing set).
* **Prediction:** Learn how to use the trained model to predict CO2 emissions for new engine sizes.

**Case Study: CO2 Emission Prediction**

The notebook applies simple linear regression to predict CO2 emissions based on engine size data. You'll learn to:

* Load and visualize the Fuel Consumption dataset.
* Split the data into training and testing sets.
* Train a simple linear regression model using engine size as the independent variable and CO2 emissions as the dependent variable.
* Evaluate the model's performance using R-squared score.
* Predict CO2 emissions for new engine sizes.
* Visualize the regression line along with the data points.

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Gain a solid understanding of simple linear regression concepts.
* Apply linear regression for modeling relationships between two continuous variables.
* Evaluate and interpret the performance of a simple linear regression model.
* Make predictions using a trained linear regression model.

**Getting Started:**

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to explore simple linear regression for fuel consumption prediction and visualize the results.

**Feel free to:**

* Use a different dataset with two continuous variables.
* Explore more complex linear regression models with multiple independent variables.
* Experiment with different evaluation metrics for regression models.
