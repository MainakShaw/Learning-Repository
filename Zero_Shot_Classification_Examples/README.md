## Zero-Shot Classification Examples

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the capabilities of zero-shot classification using the `facebook/bart-large-mnli` pre-trained model from  Transformers.

**Zero-Shot Classification:**

- Classifies text data into predefined categories without explicit training on those categories.
- Leverages the model's understanding of language relationships to assign labels based on a provided set of candidate labels.

**This Notebook Explores:**

- Sentiment analysis of product reviews (positive, negative, neutral).
- Product classification based on brand names (HP, Dell, Macbook).
- Topic classification for historical events (World War 2, Industrial Revolution).
- Historical figure classification (Hitler, World War eras).

**Getting Started:**

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`transformers`).
3. Open the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. Run the code cells sequentially to see various zero-shot classification examples.

**Note:**

- The chosen pre-trained model might require fine-tuning for optimal performance on specific tasks.

**Further Exploration:**

- Experiment with different pre-trained models and candidate label sets.
- Explore zero-shot classification for other tasks like question answering or summarization.
