## NumPy Practice with Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive exploration of NumPy, a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. 

The notebook covers:

* **The Basics:**
    * Creating arrays with various dimensions and data types.
    * Accessing and modifying elements, rows, and columns.
    * Understanding array shapes and sizes.
    * Initializing arrays with zeros, ones, and random values.

* **Mathematics:**
    * Performing element-wise arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
    * Exploring trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent).

* **Linear Algebra:**
    * Matrix multiplication using `matmul`.
    * Calculating determinants with `np.linalg.det`.

* **Statistics:**
    * Finding minimum, maximum, and sum values along different axes.

* **Reorganizing Arrays:**
    * Reshaping arrays to different dimensions.
    * Vertically and horizontally stacking vectors.

* **Miscellaneous:**
    * Loading data from text files.
    * Advanced indexing techniques (Boolean indexing, list indexing)
    * Logical operations (any, all) and bitwise operations.

Through interactive examples and exercises, you'll gain a solid foundation for:

* Data manipulation and analysis.
* Scientific computing and numerical simulations.
* Machine learning and deep learning applications.
