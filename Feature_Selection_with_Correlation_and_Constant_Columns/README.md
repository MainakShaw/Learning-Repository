## Feature Selection with Correlation and Constant Columns

This Jupyter Notebook explores feature selection, a crucial step in machine learning, demonstrating its application with correlation analysis and constant column handling on the Bajaj Housing dataset.

**The notebook covers:**

* **Feature Selection Overview:** Understand why selecting relevant features improves model training and performance.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Discover correlation analysis, a technique that measures the strength and direction of linear relationships between features.
* **Feature Selection with Correlation:** Learn how to identify highly correlated features and potentially reduce redundancy in your dataset.
* **Handling Constant Columns:** Explore techniques to identify and address constant columns that may not provide valuable information for model training.

**Case Study: Bajaj Housing Dataset**

The notebook applies correlation analysis and constant column handling for feature selection on the Bajaj Housing dataset. You'll learn to:

* Load and explore the Bajaj Housing dataset.
* Identify missing values and handle them (e.g., dropping columns).
* Calculate the correlation matrix to identify highly correlated features.
* Visualize the correlation matrix using heatmaps to understand feature relationships.
* Select a threshold for correlation and remove redundant features.
* Identify and remove constant columns that may not contribute to model performance(using VarianceThreshold).

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Gain a solid understanding of feature selection and its benefits.
* Grasp the concept of correlation analysis and its role in feature selection.
* Apply correlation analysis to select relevant features from a dataset.
* Identify and handle constant columns for improved model training.

**Getting Started:**

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to explore feature selection with correlation analysis and constant column handling using the Bajaj Housing dataset.

**Feel free to:**

* Use a different dataset and apply correlation analysis and constant column handling for feature selection.
* Explore additional feature selection techniques.
* Experiment with different correlation thresholds and see how they impact the number of selected features.
* Investigate alternative methods for handling constant columns.
