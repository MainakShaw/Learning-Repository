# Advanced Python Concepts - Functions, Lambdas, and Classes

This Jupyter notebook explores various advanced concepts in Python, including:

* **Function Enhancements:** Understanding `pass` statements, function calling with repetition, and variable length keyword arguments.
* **Lambda Functions:** Utilizing concise, anonymous functions for simple operations.
* **`zip()` Function:** Combining elements from iterables like lists.
* **`map()` Function:** Applying a function to all elements in an iterable and creating a new iterable with the results.
* **Classes and Objects:** Creating blueprints for objects and working with object attributes and methods. 
* **Constructor Function (`__init__()`):** Initializing object attributes during creation.

**Instructions:**
