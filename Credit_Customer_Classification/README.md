## Credit Customer Classification with Logistic Regression

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a logistic regression model for classifying credit customers based on their attributes in the "credit_customers.csv" dataset. 

**Key Steps:**

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
    - Loads the CSV data using pandas.
    - Analyzes missing values and drops an irrelevant column (`checking_status`).
    - Explores and visualizes data distribution (optional).

2. **Feature Encoding:**
    - Handles categorical features using One-Hot Encoding.
    - Transforms categorical columns (`credit_history` and `purpose`) into numerical representations.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Drops the original categorical columns after encoding.
    - Converts remaining object-type columns into numerical features (if applicable).

4. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    - Splits the data into training and testing sets.
    - Trains a logistic regression model using the training data.
    - Evaluates model performance on the testing data using accuracy score.
    - Optionally explores different solver options for logistic regression.

**Benefits:**

- Provides a basic framework for credit customer classification using logistic regression.
- Highlights the importance of data preprocessing and encoding categorical features.
- Demonstrates model evaluation using accuracy score.

**Getting Started:**

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to understand the credit customer classification process.

**Next Steps:**

- Explore other classification algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests).
- Implement hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Perform feature selection techniques to identify the most impactful features.
- Visualize the decision boundaries of the logistic regression model.
