## Housing Market Analysis with Data Cleaning and Exploration

This Jupyter Notebook explores a housing market dataset (`Housing Data.csv`) using Python libraries like pandas and matplotlib. The script focuses on identifying and handling missing values within the data.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Data Loading and Inspection:**
   - Reads the CSV data using pandas.
   - Displays initial rows and checks the data shape (number of rows and columns).

2. **Missing Value Analysis:**
   - Identifies the number of missing values per column using `isnull().sum()`.
   - Drops columns with a high percentage of missing values based on a user-defined threshold.

3. **Missing Value Treatment (Frontage Column):**
   - Focuses on the `Frontage` column with missing values.
   - Explores various techniques for handling missing data:
     - Mean imputation: Fills missing values with the mean value of the column.
     - Median imputation: Fills missing values with the median value of the column.
     - Mode imputation: Fills missing values with the most frequent value (mode) in the column.
     - Forward fill (ffill): Fills missing values with the previous valid value (only suitable if the first value is not null).
     - Backward fill (bfill): Fills missing values with the next valid value (only suitable if the last value is not null).
     - Interpolation: Fills missing values with the average of the previous and next valid values (suitable when both ends have values).
   - Analyzes the effectiveness of each technique using descriptive statistics like `describe()`.

4. **Choosing the Best Imputation Method:**
   - After testing various methods, the script concludes that interpolation provides the most suitable approach for the `Frontage` column based on its characteristics.

This Notebook serves as a foundational step for a comprehensive data analysis of the housing market. Feel free to modify the code and explore further to derive valuable insights!
