## Feature Selection for House Price Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook delves into feature selection techniques for building a more robust linear regression model to predict house prices in the Housing dataset. It explores various methods, including:

* **Mutual Information Regression (MIR):** Identifies features with the highest mutual information with the target variable (Sale Price).
* **Correlation Analysis:** Uncovers highly correlated features that might introduce redundancy.

**Notebook Highlights:**

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and performs scaling for better model performance.
* **Feature Selection:** Implements MIR and correlation analysis to select the most relevant features that impact house prices.
* **Linear Regression Modeling:** Trains a linear regression model with and without feature selection to compare their effectiveness.
* **Evaluation:** Analyzes model performance using R-squared score and visualizes the relationship between predicted and actual house prices.

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Gain an understanding of feature selection techniques and their importance in linear regression.
* Apply MIR and correlation analysis for feature selection in a practical scenario.
* Evaluate the impact of feature selection on model accuracy.
* Build a more refined linear regression model for house price prediction.

**Getting Started:**

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to explore feature selection and linear regression modeling for house price prediction.

**Feel free to:**

* Experiment with different feature selection techniques.
* Explore other machine learning algorithms for house price prediction.
* Visualize feature importances to understand the relative contribution of selected features.
