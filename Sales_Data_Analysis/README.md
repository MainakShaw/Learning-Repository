## Sales Data Analysis with Pandas and Seaborn

This Jupyter Notebook explores a sales data CSV file using pandas and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. The analysis covers:

* **Sales per Quarter:** Analyzes sales trends across quarters (both calendar year and fiscal year) using custom functions and bar plots.
* **Data Distribution:** Creates histograms with and without kernel density estimation to understand data distribution (focusing on price and revenue).
* **Outlier Detection:** Demonstrates outlier identification using box plots.
* **Product Sales:** Identifies top-selling and least-selling products using grouped data and bar charts.
* **Pie Charts:** Creates pie charts to visualize the distribution of product IDs with options for highlighting specific products.
* **Heatmap:** Generates a heatmap using Seaborn to explore correlations between numerical features in the dataset.
* **Data Transformation:** Applies Box-Cox transformation to address right-skewed revenue data and visualizes the transformed distribution.

**Libraries Used:**

* pandas: Data manipulation and processing
* numpy: Used for numerical operations (optional for box plots and heatmaps)
* matplotlib.pyplot: Base plotting library (used by Seaborn)
* seaborn: Advanced data visualization library
* wordcloud (optional): For creating word clouds (not used in this analysis)
* scipy.stats: For Box-Cox transformation (used for revenue data)

This project demonstrates various data analysis techniques using Python libraries. Feel free to modify the code to explore your own sales data and uncover valuable insights!
