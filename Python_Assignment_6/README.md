## Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic Disaster

This Jupyter Notebook delves into a dataset containing information about passengers onboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic. The data (provided as `Titanic.csv` in this repository) is analyzed using pandas and seaborn libraries to uncover insights into passenger demographics, survival rates, and potential correlations between features.

**Analysis Steps:**

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:**
   - Reads the `Titanic.csv` file using pandas.
   - Handles missing values (if any) using appropriate techniques like imputation or deletion.
2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Examines data types, identifies null values, and explores descriptive statistics.
   - Analyzes passenger characteristics like age, class, fare, and survival status.
   - Creates visualizations (histograms, boxplots) to understand data distribution and outliers.
3. **Passenger Grouping:**
   - Groups passengers by factors like Pclass (passenger class), embarked location, or age range.
   - Calculates statistics (mean, median, etc.) for each group.
   - Uses pivot tables to analyze survival rates based on combinations of passenger characteristics.
4. **Visualization Techniques:**
   - Creates bar charts to visualize passenger counts within categories.
   - Generates scatter plots to explore relationships between numerical features like age and fare.
   - Colors data points in scatter plots based on survival status for deeper insights.

**Libraries Used:**

* pandas: Data manipulation and processing
* numpy (optional): Used for numerical operations (box plots, scatter plots)
* matplotlib.pyplot (base plotting library used by seaborn)
* seaborn: Advanced data visualization library

This Notebook serves as a foundation for a comprehensive data analysis of the Titanic disaster. Feel free to modify the code and delve deeper to uncover hidden patterns within the data!
