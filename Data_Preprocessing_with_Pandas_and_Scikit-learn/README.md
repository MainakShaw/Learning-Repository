## Data Preprocessing with Pandas and scikit-learn

This Jupyter Notebook delves into essential data preprocessing techniques using pandas and scikit-learn libraries in Python.

**The notebook covers the following topics:**

* **Data Cleaning:** Learn how to handle missing values, remove irrelevant columns, and manipulate data using pandas functionalities.
* **Data Transformation:** Discover techniques like scaling (StandardScaler & MinMaxScaler) to transform numerical features into a common range.
* **Data Encoding:** Explore methods like Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Gain practical experience with pandas and scikit-learn for data preprocessing tasks.
* Understand the importance of data preprocessing for machine learning algorithms.
* Apply these techniques to prepare your datasets for model training.

**Getting Started:**

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to explore the functionalities and experiment with different data manipulation tasks.

**Feel free to:**

* Modify the provided dataset or use your own data for preprocessing practice.
* Explore additional data cleaning techniques like handling outliers.
* Apply learned encoding methods to handle different types of categorical data.
