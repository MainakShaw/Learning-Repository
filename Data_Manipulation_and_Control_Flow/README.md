# Data Structures and Conditional Statements in Python

This Jupyter notebook explores additional data structures in Python, including sets (unordered collections without duplicates) and dictionaries (key-value pairs for storing data). The notebook demonstrates how to create sets, perform basic operations like adding/removing elements, and explore shallow vs. deep copying. Additionally, the notebook introduces you to dictionaries, their functionalities like accessing values by keys, updating values, and iterating over key-value pairs. Finally, the notebook provides a basic introduction to conditional statements (if-else, elif) in Python for making decisions based on conditions.
