## Pandas and Matplotlib Practice with Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook provides a hands-on exploration of Pandas and Matplotlib, essential libraries for data manipulation and visualization in Python:

* **Pandas:**
    * Handling missing values (NaNs) with `dropna`.
    * Data type conversion with `.astype`.
    * Identifying and removing duplicate rows.
    * Filtering data using boolean indexing.

* **Matplotlib:**
    * Creating basic line plots.
    * Customizing plot elements like labels, titles, and markers.
    * Generating bar charts and pie charts.
    * Using subplots for multiple visualizations.
    * Creating scatter plots.

The notebook utilizes clear explanations and interactive examples, helping you:

* Clean and prepare data in Pandas for analysis.
* Explore and visualize data trends using Matplotlib.
* Gain a solid foundation for further data analysis and visualization tasks.
