## Text Analysis with spaCy 

This Jupyter Notebook delves into the world of text analysis using spaCy, a powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) library in Python.

**The notebook explores various capabilities of spaCy, including:**

* **Model Loading:** Learn how to load pre-trained spaCy models (like `en_core_web_sm`) for various languages.
* **Tokenization:** Explore how spaCy automatically tokenizes text into meaningful units like words.
* **Stop Word Removal:** Identify and remove stop words (e.g., "the," "a") using spaCy's token properties.
* **Lemmatization:** Understand how spaCy provides lemmatized forms (base forms) of words.
* **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Discover how spaCy assigns grammatical labels (e.g., noun, verb) to words in a sentence.
* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Learn to extract named entities like people, locations, and organizations from text.
* **Text Similarity:** Explore calculating the similarity between different text pieces using spaCy's functionality.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Introduce sentiment analysis with VADER to determine the emotional tone of text (positive, negative, or neutral).

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Gain practical experience with spaCy's functionalities for advanced text analysis.
* Understand how these techniques enhance various NLP applications.
* Apply spaCy to perform in-depth analysis on your own text datasets.

**Getting Started:**

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to explore the functionalities and experiment with different text examples.

**Feel free to:**

* Modify the text examples and explore different spaCy functionalities (e.g., dependency parsing).
* Integrate spaCy with other NLP libraries for complex tasks.
* Apply your newfound skills to analyze text data for various purposes.
