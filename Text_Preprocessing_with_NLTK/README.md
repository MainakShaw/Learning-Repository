## Text Preprocessing with NLTK

This Jupyter Notebook explores fundamental text preprocessing techniques using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python.

**The notebook covers the following topics:**

* **Tokenization:** Learn how to break down text into meaningful units like words or sentences using `word_tokenize` and `sent_tokenize`.
* **Stopword Removal:** Discover how to identify and remove commonly used stopwords like "the," "a," and "is" using NLTK's stopword corpus.
* **Stemming:** Explore the concept of stemming, which reduces words to their base forms (e.g., "programs" -> "program"). This notebook demonstrates Porter Stemming.
* **Lemmatization:** Understand lemmatization, a more advanced technique that considers word context to derive the root form while preserving meaning (e.g., "running" -> "run"). This notebook demonstrates WordNet Lemmatization.
* **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Get introduced to POS tagging, which assigns grammatical labels (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to words in a sentence.

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Gain practical experience with NLTK functionalities for text preprocessing.
* Understand the importance of preprocessing for natural language processing applications.
* Apply these techniques to clean and prepare text data for further analysis.

**Getting Started:**

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to explore the functionalities and experiment with different text examples.

**Feel free to:**

* Modify the example text and explore the impact of different stopwords lists.
* Experiment with different stemming and lemmatization algorithms (if applicable).
* Apply your newfound skills to preprocess your own text datasets.
