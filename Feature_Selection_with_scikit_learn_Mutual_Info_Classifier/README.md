## Feature Selection with scikit-learn's Mutual Info Classifier

This Jupyter Notebook explores feature selection, a crucial step in machine learning, and demonstrates its application using `mutual_info_classif` from scikit-learn.

**The notebook covers:**

* **Feature Selection Overview:** Understand why selecting relevant features improves model training and performance.
* **Mutual Information in scikit-learn:** Discover scikit-learn's `mutual_info_classif` function that calculates Mutual Information (MI) for feature selection in classification tasks.
* **Feature Selection with `mutual_info_classif`:** Learn how to identify and select features with high MI scores, potentially leading to better model performance.

**Case Study: Water Potability Prediction**

The notebook applies scikit-learn's `mutual_info_classif` for feature selection on a water potability dataset. You'll learn to:

* Load and explore the water potability dataset.
* Identify missing values and handle them (e.g., dropping rows).
* Separate features (X) and the target variable (y).
* Calculate MI scores between each feature and the target variable using `mutual_info_classif`.
* Visualize MI scores to identify the most informative features.

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Gain a solid understanding of feature selection and its benefits.
* Grasp the concept of Mutual Information and its application in feature selection using scikit-learn.
* Apply `mutual_info_classif` to select relevant features for classification tasks.

**Getting Started:**

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to explore feature selection with `mutual_info_classif` and experiment with the water potability dataset.

**Feel free to:**

* Use a different dataset and apply `mutual_info_classif` for feature selection.
* Explore additional feature selection techniques (e.g., correlation analysis).
* Experiment with different feature selection strategies to optimize model performance on your datasets.
