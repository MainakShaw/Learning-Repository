# Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Dive Deeper

This Jupyter notebook delves into advanced concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, including:

* **Class Methods:** Defining attributes and instance (object) methods within a class.
* **Constructor Function (`__init__()`):** Initializing object attributes during creation.
* **Inheritance:** Creating child classes that inherit attributes and methods from parent classes.
* **Method Resolution Order (MRO):** Understanding how method calls are resolved in inheritance hierarchies.

**Instructions:**

1. Save this file as `.ipynb`.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially using Jupyter Notebook.
