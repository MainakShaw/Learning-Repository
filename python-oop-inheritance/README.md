## Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Inheritance Exploration

This Jupyter Notebook delves into the concept of inheritance in Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. It explores:

* **Inheritance Principles:** Creating child classes that inherit attributes and methods from parent classes.
* **Constructor Overriding:** Modifying how child classes initialize their objects.
* **Utilizing `super()`:** Employing the `super()` method for efficient inheritance management.

**Exercises:**

1. Defining a `Person` Class
2. Creating a `Student` Subclass
3. Overriding the Constructor in the Subclass
4. Utilizing `super()` for Efficient Inheritance

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Understand the benefits and mechanics of inheritance.
* Implement constructor overrides for specialized object initialization.
* Leverage the `super()` method for cleaner and more maintainable code in inheritance hierarchies.
