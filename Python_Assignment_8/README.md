## Breast Cancer Preprocessing and Feature Selection

This Jupyter Notebook tackles preprocessing and feature selection, crucial steps in machine learning, using the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn.

**The notebook covers:**

* **Data Preprocessing:** Explore techniques like handling missing values, removing constant columns, and feature scaling for numerical features.
* **Feature Selection:** Discover methods like correlation analysis and mutual information-based selection to identify informative features for classification tasks.

The notebook demonstrates preprocessing and feature selection on the breast cancer dataset, which might be used for cancer diagnosis prediction. You'll learn to:

* Load and explore the breast cancer dataset.
* Check for and handle missing values (if any).
* Identify and remove constant columns (columns with no variation).
* Encode categorical features (if present) using appropriate techniques.
* Apply standard scaling for numerical feature normalization.
* Perform correlation analysis to identify highly correlated features and remove redundancy.
* Utilize mutual information-based feature selection to select features relevant to the target variable (cancer diagnosis).

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Gain a practical understanding of data preprocessing for machine learning tasks.
* Apply feature selection techniques like correlation analysis and mutual information-based selection.
* Improve the performance of machine learning models by selecting relevant features.

**Getting Started:**

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to explore data preprocessing, feature selection, and visualize the results.

**Feel free to:**

* Use different feature selection techniques (e.g., principal component analysis).
* Experiment with various hyperparameters for feature selection algorithms.
* Apply the techniques to a different classification dataset.
